It is downloaded and used by millions of people. The paper analyzes a critical vulnerability that I reported, as well as the patch that was applied. This zero-click vulnerability affected all phones, on all versions of the application, and made it possible to break the main functionality of the application without leaving any trace. It allowed users to have all their meals paid for by other people using only their phone numbers, without them being able to do anything about it. During my analysis, I was warned that other students had, 4 years earlier, found this vulnerability. This meant that it had been present for at least as long. Although The vulnerability had not been reported by these student. I reported the vulnerability to the Izly developers on October 26, 2022 with the email: support.izly@s-money.fr which appears on the Play Store (no other contact is available on the site). Then, seeing that they didn’t reply, I sent a report to ANSSI on December 1, 2022 via the email they gave on their site: cert-fr@ssi.gouv.fr with their PGP key, and they replied immediately. The vulnerability was corrected from April 15 to 26, 2023 with a forced update. Izly never contacted me for help or threats, but ANSSI confirmed that it was following my complaint that the application was patched.

Only one website so far allows you to easily compare the privacy of browsers, it is privacytests.org created by Arthur Edelstein. It is questionable whether a simple comparison table is reliable for comparing browsers. Indeed, the website is becoming famous and has a real impact on the decision of users and browsers. Yet, to my knowledge, there is no in-depth paper or video that looks at the subject. This article therefore aims to understand the website and analyze it: What do the tests? Are they biased?
