# Overview Of Privacytests.org


<!--more-->

It is difficult to know which browser really respects your privacy, the subject is complex and the truth hard to find.

Only one website so far allows you to easily compare the privacy of browsers, it is [privacytests.org](https://privacytests.org) created by [Arthur Edelstein](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthuredelstein/).

It is questionable whether a simple comparison table is reliable for comparing browsers.

Indeed, the website is becoming famous and has a real impact on the decision of users and browsers. Yet, to my knowledge, there is no in-depth paper or video that looks at the subject.

This article therefore aims to understand the website and analyze it: What do the tests? Are they biased? Reproducible? Relevant? What are the site's reviews and are they relevant?
